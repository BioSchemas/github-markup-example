# Welcome to Hello Fruit, a Bioschemas markup example on GitHub pages

All branches (main, gh-pages, gh-pages-with-markup) in this repository are created to show how to use Bioschemas markup on GitHub pages, following two approaches:
1. Adding markup directly to a page
2. Using a layout for a specifc type of page and then adding the corresponding markup for it

So far it is not intended to be used on its onw but as part of a Bioschemas tutorial. The branches are described as follows:
* main has some dummy code in a Jupyter Notebook that loads a CSV and creates a hello message from one of the rows
* gh-pages is this branch and fluctuates between gh-pages-basic and gh-pages-with-markup 
* gh-pages-basic is a branch with no markup at all
* gh-pages-with-markup is the branch where the Bioschemas markup is applied and used

We provide examples for three profiles
* Dataset [draft 0.4](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Dataset/0.4-DRAFT), more details for the markup example on the [data page](./data.md)
* Computational tool [release 1.0](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/ComputationalTool/1.0-RELEASE), more details for the markup example on the [software page](./software.md)
* Training materials [draft 0.9](https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/0.9-DRAFT-2020_12_08), more details for the markup example on the [tutorial page](./tutorial.md)

**Note:** the current version of the GitHub pages corresponds to gh-pages-basic, i.e., no markup added but only text
